        testing this to see if lesson 8 folder will update along with this file through souce control. Looks like I have
        no clue what I'm doing. I just want to get this off
        my freaking computer so it's not holding up space. UGH! Frustrating.

        doing another test to see which Github folder this goes to directly.
